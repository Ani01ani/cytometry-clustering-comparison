# How to run ACCENSE

# Not available in R, so follow steps below instead:

# Requires: Standalone ACCENSE application

# 1. Run ACCENSE application
# 2. Select "Dimension reduction" under "Functions to run", set parameters, select
# columns of markers, and click on "Run".
# 3. When dimensionality reduction is complete, proceed to the clustering step. Note that
# the output file "accense_output.csv" contains the dimensionality reduction results, and
# can be loaded to continue directly from the clustering step.
# 4. Inspect the t-SNE projection visually.
# 5. To perform clustering, select "Classification and colouring", select either k-means 
# or DBSCAN, and click "Calculate". After the clustering is complete, the output file 
# "accense_output.csv" will be updated to include the cluster labels.
