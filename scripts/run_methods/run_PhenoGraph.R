# How to run PhenoGraph

# Not available in R, so follow steps below instead:

# Requires: Matlab, Statistics Toolbox

# 1. Open "cyt" GUI from Matlab by typing "cyt" in command window.
# 2. Load FCS file by clicking on green "plus" symbol under Gates.
# 3. Select all protein markers under Channels.
# 4. Right-click and select PhenoGraph.
# 5. Select "Run on individual gates" ("Run on all gates together" currently gives an 
# error). This requires data from all cell populations to be in the same FCS file. If you
# have multiple FCS files, concatenate them together first.
# 6. Set parameters and click "Cluster" to run.
# 7. Save output as a new FCS file by clicking on the save icon under Gates.
