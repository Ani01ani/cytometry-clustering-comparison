## Overview

In this study, we compared the performance of 18 clustering methods for automated detection of cell populations in high-dimensional flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data, using 6 publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology as benchmarks. These results extend previously published comparisons by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods developed for CyTOF data.

A list of the clustering methods can be found in Table 1 in the paper. A list of the data sets is provided in Table 2.

The comparisons showed that several methods performed well, including FlowSOM, X-shift, PhenoGraph, Rclusterpp, and flowMeans. Among these, FlowSOM had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer.

Based on our results, we recommend the use of FlowSOM (with manual selection of the number of clusters; see paper) as a first choice for this type of analysis, since this method gave best or near-best performance across all data sets, together with extremely fast runtimes.

See the paper for more details, in particular regarding the advantages of the different methods for different clustering tasks (detecting multiple cell populations vs. detecting a single rare population).



## FlowSOM and Rtsne example code

FlowSOM [(Van Gassen et al., 2015)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25573116) is available as a [Bioconductor package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html) for the R statistical programming language.

A worked example showing how to use FlowSOM for clustering and [Rtsne](https://github.com/jkrijthe/Rtsne) for visualization is available in the [FlowSOM-Rtsne-example](https://github.com/lmweber/FlowSOM-Rtsne-example) repository.
