# Comparison of clustering methods for high-dimensional single-cell flow and mass cytometry data

## Overview

This repository contains R scripts to reproduce the analysis in our paper on comparing clustering methods for high-dimensional single-cell flow and mass cytometry data.

We compared 13 methods, using 2 publicly available data sets. The data sets are:

- Levine_2015_marrow_32: a 32-dimensional mass cytometry data set containing 14 major cell populations, from Levine et al. (2015).

- Mosmann_2014_rare: a 15-dimensional flow cytometry data set containing one rare cell population of interest, from Mosmann et al. (2014).


## Contents

R scripts are saved in the [scripts](scripts/) folder.

Currently, the repository contains R scripts only. The final version will also include PDF files of all figures used in the paper.
